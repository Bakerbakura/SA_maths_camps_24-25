\item Find all functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) for which there are real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that, for all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\), we have \(f(x) + f(y) = ax + by\).

\item Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle BCD = 90^{\circ}$. Let $P$ be on $CD$ such that $\angle APD = \angle BPC$ and $\angle BAP = \angle ABC$. Prove that \[BC = \frac{AP + BP}{2}.\]

\item The rational numbers \(r\), \(s\), and \(t\) are such that \(rs\), \(r + s\), \(r + st\), and \(s + rt\) are all nonzero and
\[\frac{1}{r + s} = \frac{1}{r + st} + \frac{1}{s + rt}.\]
Show that \((t - 3)(t + 1)\) is the square of some rational number.

\item In a 40-by-50 array of control buttons, each button has two states: ON and OFF. By touching a button, its state and the states of all buttons in the same row and in the same column are switched. Prove that the array of control buttons may be altered from the all-OFF state to the all-ON state by touching buttons successively, and determine the least number of touches needed to do so.

\item Let us say that a triple \((a, b, c)\) is \emph{special} if and only if \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive integers such that \(a \neq b \neq c \neq a\) and \(\gcd(a^{b}, b^{c}, c^{a}) = \gcd(a^{c}, c^{b}, b^{a})\). Prove that for each positive integer \(M\), there exists a special triple \((a, b, c)\) such that \(\gcd(a, b, c) > M\).
