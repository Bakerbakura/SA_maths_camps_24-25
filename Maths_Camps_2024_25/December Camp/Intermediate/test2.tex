\item Find all primes $p$
such that there is at least one integer $x$
such that
\begin{align*}
p &|5x-8
\\ p &|8x-10
\\ p &|11x-5
\end{align*}

\item Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram with an acute angle at $A$. Let $G$ be a point on line $AB$, distinct from $B$, such that $\overline{CG}=\overline{CB}$. Let $H$ be a point on line $BC$, distinct from $B$, such that $\overline{AB}=\overline{AH}$. Prove that $\triangle DGH$ is isosceles.  
\item For all real numbers $x$ prove that

$$x^4 + 3x^2 + 2 \geq 2x^3 + 4x$$.

\item A \emph{Collatz sequence} is a sequence \((a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)\) of positive integers \(a_{k}\) such that for all non-negative integers \(k\),
\[a_{k + 1} = \begin{cases}
\frac{a_{k}}{2} & \textrm{if \(a_{k}\) is even}\\
3a_{k} + 1 & \textrm{if \(a_{k}\) is odd.}
\end{cases}\]
Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers \(N\) such that if \((a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)\) is the Collatz sequence such that \(a_{0} = N\), and     \(a_{N} = 1\).
\item The pupils in a class are arranged in a row so that for each three consecutive pupils, the first pupil's height is between the second and third pupils' heights. The teacher asks every second pupil in the row to step forward, so that two lines of pupils form. Show that both lines are sorted by height.
