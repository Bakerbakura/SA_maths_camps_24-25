\item Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle, $M$ the midpoint of the side $AC$, and $F$ the foot on $AB$ of the altitude through the vertex $C$. Prove that if $\angle BAC = 60^{\circ}$ then $AM = AF$. 
\item Alice and Bob play the following game. At the start, the number \(n\) has the value 0. The players take turns; on each turn, the current player increases \(n\) by one of the following numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The winner is the player who causes \(n\) to be greater than or equal to 2024 for the first time. With Alice playing first, which player, if either, can guarantee victory in this game?
\item Find the largest 2024-digit number consisting of only $1$s and $2$s such that the number is a multiple of $72$.
\item Find all functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) for which there are real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that, for all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\), we have \(f(x) + f(y) = ax + by\).
\item Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle BCD = 90^{\circ}$. Let $P$ be on $CD$ such that $\angle APD = \angle BPC$ and $\angle BAP = \angle ABC$. Prove that \[BC = \frac{AP + BP}{2}.\]
