\begin{enumerate}
\item A \emph{Collatz sequence} is a sequence \((a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)\) of positive integers \(a_{k}\) such that for all non-negative integers \(k\),
\[a_{k + 1} = \begin{cases}
\frac{a_{k}}{2} & \textrm{if \(a_{k}\) is even}\\
3a_{k} + 1 & \textrm{if \(a_{k}\) is odd.}
\end{cases}\]
Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers \(N\) such that if \((a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots)\) is the Collatz sequence such that \(a_{0} = N\), then \(a_{N} = 1\).
\item The pupils in a class are arranged in a row so that for each three consecutive pupils, the first pupil's height is between the second and third pupils' heights. The teacher asks every second pupil in the row to step forward, so that two lines of pupils form. Show that both lines are sorted by height.
\item In $\triangle ABC$, $\angle ABC > \angle BCA$. Let $D$ be the point on the side $BC$ such that $\angle DAC = \frac{\angle ABC - \angle BCA}{2}$. The circumcircle of $\triangle ACD$ meets side $AB$ again at $E$. The circumcircle of $\triangle ABD$ meets side $AC$ again at $F$. The internal angle bisector of $\angle BDE$ meets the side $AB$ of $P$. The internal angle bisector of $\angle CDF$ meets the side $AC$ at $Q$. Show that $PQ \perp AB$.
\item Let \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) be positive real numbers. Prove that
\[a^{2}b^{2} + b^{2}c^{2} + c^{2}a^{2} + \frac{1}{3}(a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2})^{2} \geqslant \frac{1}{2}((ab + bc)^{2} + (bc + ca)^{2} + (ca + ab)^{2}).\]
\item Consider a 25-by-25 grid of unit squares. With a red pen, draw contours of squares of any size on the grid. What is the minimum number of squares we must draw in order to colour the entire grid red?
