\item The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ of a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ intersect at $P$. The circumcircle of the triangle $PDC$ intersects $BC$ at a point $E$, beyond $C$, and intersects $AD$ at a point $F$, beyond $D$. The circumcircle of the triangle $PAB$ intersects $BC$ at a point $H$, between $B$ and $C$, and intersects $AD$ at a point $G$, beyond $A$. Prove that $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$ lie on the circumference of a circle with centre $P$.
\item Find all pairs \((p, q)\) of prime numbers such that, for some positive integer \(a\), we have
\[p^{2} + 5pq + 4q^{2} = a^{2}.\]
\item A tournament took place among 401 players. Each two players played exactly one game. In each game, one player won and the other player lost. Prove that there is a way to put the players in a row from left to right so that for each two consecutive players in the row, the player on the left lost to the player on the right.
\item Let \(ABC\) be a triangle with \(AB \neq AC\). Let \(M\) be the midpoint of \(BC\), and let \(N\) be the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) of the circumcircle of the triangle \(ABC\) containing \(A\). Let \(H\) be the foot of the perpendicular from \(N\) to \(AC\). The circumcircle of the triangle \(AMC\) and the line \(CN\) meet at \(K\), and we have \(K \neq C\). Prove \(\angle AKH = \angle CAM\).
\item We are given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Show that
\[\left(\frac{a}{a + b}\right)^{3} + \left(\frac{b}{b + c}\right)^{3} + \left(\frac{c}{c + a}\right)^{3} \geqslant \frac{3}{8}.\]
