These folders are currently in use by the April Camp coaches for preparation of tests for the South African Team Selection Camp (April Camp) 2025.
Please do not share any questions and/or test information in these folders outside of the South African coaches' circle until the conclusion of April Camp 2025, particularly in such a way that a potential April Camp attendee might stumble across them.
